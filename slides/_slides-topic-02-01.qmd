# Computational Literacy

# Historical Context

# What is a Computer?

## What is a Computer?

<br>

-   Historically, a computer was a person who makes calculations, especially with a calculating machine.

<br>

-   To do calculations we use numbers. How to represent them?

## Representing numbers

<br>

Simplest ways to physically represent numbers for arithmetic:

-   Counting fingers
-   Marked stones, or marked bones
-   Incan Rope counting, called [Quipu](https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/inca-khipu.html)
-   The [Abacus](https://www.ecb.torontomu.ca/~elf/abacus/)

-   Main feature: the program and any data are both stored together, usually in a slow-to-access storage medium such as a hard disk, and transferred as required to a faster, and more volatile storage medium [(RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) for execution or processing by a central processing unit (CPU).

-   Since this, it is how practically all present day computers work, the term "Von Neumann architecture" is rarely used now, but it was in common parlance in the computing profession through to the early 1970s.

-   When Von Neumann proposed this architecture in 1945, it was a radical idea. Prior to then, programs were viewed as essentially part of the machine, and hence different from the data the machine operated on.

## What is Binary?

-   A binary number is written using only the digits 0 and 1.

-   A single binary digit is a bit, e.g., 101 has three bits.

-   An 8-bit group is called a byte.

-   Binary numbers grow as follows:

    -   0 represents zero
    -   1 represents one
    -   10 represents two
    -   100 represents four
    -   1000 represents eight, and so on...

 ## Chess Board Legend - Problem 1

An old legend about a Sage who wins a chess game and asks for grains of rice, doubling on each square.

---

## Calculating Grains of Rice

- **Question:** How many grains of rice should the sage receive? (Answer using Bash)

1. 4294967296
2. 562949953421312
3. 18446744073709551615
4. 128

*Note: Bash does not handle floating-point calculations.*

---

## The Weight of Rice

- A billion grains of rice weigh approximately 25 tonnes.
- To cover all 64 squares on a chessboard, one would need about 460 billion tonnes of rice.

---

## Sage's Payment Plan

The Sage allows the King to pay the debt over time by serving rice to pilgrims every day.

---

## Bash and Integer Representation

- **Question:** What is the output of `echo $((2**64))`?

1. 0
2. 128
3. 4294967296
4. 18446744073709551616

---

## Using bc for Calculations

- In Bash, `bc` can be used for more complex calculations, like so:

```bash
echo "2^4" | bc # Outputs 16



So what, what is so great about 64 switches being able to represent all the numbers from 0 up to 18446744073709551615?

We can use them for more than representing numbers...they can represent characters like A or !

<br>

-   A **character** is the smallest component of text, like A, B, or /.
-   A [**glyph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph) is the graphical representation of a character.
-   In programming, the display of glyphs is typically handled by GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkits or font renderers.
:::
:::

# Converting instructions into Binary

## ASCII - The Basics

<br>

-   **ASCII** stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
-   Standardized in 1968, it defines numeric codes for characters, ranging from 0 to 127.
-   Each character is assigned a unique numeric code value.

## ASCII Codes

<br>

-   ASCII defined numeric codes for various characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127. For example, the lowercase letter ‘a’ is assigned 97 as its code value.
-   Uppercase 'A' is represented by the code value 65.
-   The code value 0 is the 'NUL' character, also known as the null byte.

## ASCII Character Range

<br>

-   Control characters: Codes 0 through 31 and 127 are unprintable.
-   Spacing character: Code 32 is a nonprinting space.
-   Graphic characters: Codes 33 through 126 are printable.

## ASCII Limitations

<br>

-   ASCII only includes unaccented characters.
-   Languages requiring accented characters cannot be represented.
-   Even English needs characters like ‘é’ for words such as ‘café’.

## Practice Exercise

<br>

-   Write the characters of your name using ASCII codes.

    -   [Check this table!](https://www.rapidtables.com/code/text/ascii-table.html)

## Practice Exercise

<br>

[Here we have an online translator!](http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/ascii/)

. . .

'DAVI' using ASCII codes.

| Character | ASCII Code |
|-----------|------------|
| D         | 68         |
| A         | 65         |
| V         | 86         |
| I         | 73         |

*Note: If ASCII does not support characters in your name, [Unicode](https://docs.python.org/3.0/howto/unicode.html) will provide a solution.*

## Hexadecimal and Unicode

<br>

-   ASCII uses 7 bits, limiting its range.
-   To represent a broader range of characters, more bits are needed.
-   Hexadecimal, or hex, is used in Unicode to represent these characters efficiently.

## What is Hexadecimal?

<br>

-   Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system.
-   Hex digits include: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
-   In programming, hex is encountered more often than binary for compactness.

## Hex to Binary Mapping

<br>

-   Each hex digit corresponds to 4 binary bits:

    -   0000 = 0
    -   0001 = 1
    -   0010 = 2
    -   ...
    -   1110 = E
    -   1111 = F

-   One hex digit represents 4 bits, making it a shorthand for binary.

-   This is due to the fact that four binary digits can represent sixteen possible values ($2^4$), which aligns with the sixteen possible values of a single hex digit (0 to F).

## Binary to Hex Conversion

<br>

-   Convert binary to hex by grouping into blocks of four bits.
-   Example: Binary `1001 1110 0000 1010` converts to Hex `9E0A`.


## Practice Exercise


1. Convert the decimal number 13 to binary.

2. Convert the decimal number 13 to hexadecimal.

<!---

## Practice Exercise: Solution {.scrollable .smaller}

1. Decimal 13 is `1101` in binary.

    -   Break it down: $13 = (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^0)$.

2. Binary 1101 is `D` in hexadecimal.

    - Group the binary into blocks of four: `1101`.
    - Convert each block to hex: `1101` (binary) = `D` (hex).

    -   Let's take a closer look at how to convert the binary number `1101` to hexadecimal:

    - Start with the binary number: `1101`
    - Convert it to decimal by summing the powers of 2:
    
        - $1 \times 2^3$ = 8
        - $1 \times 2^2$ = 4
        - $0 \times 2^1$ = 0
        - $1 \times 2^0$ = 1
    
    - Add the decimal values: $8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13$

    - The decimal number `13` corresponds to the hexadecimal number `D`.

    - Therefore, binary `1101` is `D` in hexadecimal.

--->

## Practice Exercise

Now, convert the decimal number 27 to binary and then to hexadecimal.


<!---

## Practice Exercise Solution - part 1/2

1. **Decimal to Binary**:

. . . 

- Divide the number by 2 and write down the remainder.

- Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until you get a quotient of zero.

- Write out the remainders in reverse order.

. . .

For the number `27`:

- $27 / 2$ = 13 with a remainder of $1$.
- $13 / 2$ = 6 with a remainder of $1$.
- $6 / 2$ = 3 with a remainder of $0$.
- $3 / 2$ = 1 with a remainder of $1$.
- $1 / 2$ = 0 with a remainder of $1$.

. . .

Writing the remainders in reverse order gives us the binary: `11011`.


## Practice Exercise Solution - part 2/2

2. **Binary to Hexadecimal**:

. . . 

For the binary number `11011`:

. . .

1. Group the binary number into sets of four from the right: `1 1011`.

2. Add a leading zero to the leftmost group to make it a set of four: `0001 1011`.

3. Convert each group to hexadecimal:
    - `0001` is `1` in hexadecimal.
    - `1011` is `B` in hexadecimal.

4. Combine the hexadecimal values to get the final result: `1B`.

. . .

Therefore, decimal `27` is `11011` in binary and `1B` in hexadecimal.

## Hexadecimal in File Formats

<br>

-   Files in hex format are often referred to as "binary" files.
-   This terminology is due to the direct conversion between hex and binary.
-   The conversion is unambiguous, making it a practical shorthand.

## Hexadecimal in HTML

-   HTML uses hexadecimal to represent colors.

-   Six-digit hex numbers specify colors:

    -   FFFFFF = White
    -   000000 = Black

-   Each pair of digits represents a color component (RGB).

-   Each color channel typically has a range from 0 to 255 (in 8-bit systems), which gives a total of 256 intensity levels for each primary color.

-   When you combine the three channels, you get a possible color palette of $256^3$ or about 16.7 million colors.

-   For example, an RGB value of 255, 0, 0 corresponds to bright red because the red channel is at full intensity, and the green and blue channels are off.

# Understanding Unicode and UTF-8

## Encountering Unicode

<br>

-   Encountering a `UnicodeDecodeError` in Python indicates a character encoding issue.

-   This often arises when dealing with characters not represented in the ASCII set.

## What is Unicode?

<br>

-   Unicode is a standard that maps characters to code points.
-   A code point is an integer, usually represented in hexadecimal.
-   A Unicode string is a series of code points.
-   Encoding is the rule set for converting code points to bytes.

## ASCII and Unicode

<br>

-   Unicode code points $<$ 128 directly map to ASCII bytes.
-   Code points $>=$ 128 cannot be encoded in ASCII.
-   Python will raise a `UnicodeEncodeError` for these cases.
-   Unicode code charts: [Unicode Charts](http://www.unicode.org/charts/)

## UTF-8 Encoding

<br>

-   UTF-8 stands for Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit.
-   It is a variable-width encoding representing every Unicode character.
-   Python uses UTF-8 by default for source code.

<!---

## Specifying Unicode in Python

-   Python supports writing source code in UTF-8 by default:

    -   `\xnn` for a two-digit hex code point.
    -   `\unnnn` for a four-digit hex code point.
    -   `\Unnnnnnnn` for an eight-digit hex code point.
    -   Use full digit count, padding with leading zeroes as necessary.


--->

## Example

-   To write "DAVI" in Unicode (UTF-8) using hexadecimal code points, you would use the Unicode code points for each character.

-   In UTF-8, the characters in the standard ASCII set, which includes uppercase English letters, are represented by the same values as in ASCII. The code points for 'D', 'A', 'V', and 'I' are as follows:

    -   "D": "\\u0044"
    -   "A": "\\u0041"
    -   "V": "\\u0056"
    -   "I": "\\u0049"

-   "DAVI" in Unicode (UTF-8) using these escape sequences would be represented as "\\u0044\\u0041\\u0056\\u0049".

# High vs Low-Level Languages and the Genesis of Programming

```{=html}
<!---
## The Genesis of Programming
-   The earliest digital computers were Konrad Zuse's Computers.
-   In 1943, Zuse described computing as the deviation from a prescription to result specifications.
- These computers were programmable and worked on binary instructions.

::: {.column width="40%"}
<br>

-   Zuse's computers, including Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4, were designed to read binary instructions from punch tape.
-   The logic of these machines was based on binary switching mechanisms (0-1 principle).
-   Example: Z4 had 512 bytes of memory.

## What is Assembly Language?

<br>

-   Assembly language allows writing machine code in human-readable text.
-   Early assembly programming involved writing code on paper, which was then transcribed to punch cards.

<br>

-   **High-Level Languages:** Abstract from hardware details, portable across different systems.

-   **Low-Level Languages:** Closer to machine code, require consideration of hardware specifics.
:::
:::

## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

<br>

-   **Compiled Languages:** Convert code to binary instructions before execution (e.g., `C++`, `Fortran`, `Go`).

-   **Interpreted Languages:** Run inside a program that interprets and executes commands immediately (e.g., `R`, `Python`).

## Performance and Flexibility

<br>

-   Compiled languages are generally faster but require a compilation step.
-   Interpreted languages are more flexible but can be slower, though this can be mitigated (e.g., `Python` with `C++` libraries).

# Summary
