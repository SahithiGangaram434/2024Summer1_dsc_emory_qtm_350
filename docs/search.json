Please note that no extensions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nPractice Activities\nSome lectures will be accompanied by a practice activity, available on the course’s Canvas page or Webpage to be completed individually. Students may complete these quizzes and activities either during or after class, the due dates will be posted in the course canvas page. While individual submission is mandatory, collaborative discussions are encouraged. Please note that no extensions will be granted under any circumstances, ensuring fairness and consistency in assessment for all students.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nProblem sets aligned with some of covered topics will be assigned to solidify your learning. These sets are to be collaboratively developed in groups of up to three members, emphasizing the importance of code collaboration. Consequently, individual submissions will not be accepted. Assignments will be distributed via Canvas, and may be formatted as either a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), Quarto documents (.qmd), or HTML (.html). Groups will be required to submit the complete source code of their assignments (.ipynb, .qmd, or .html). Each problem set will be meticulously evaluated, with grading based on both the accuracy and the overall quality of the work submitted. For instance, you must guarantee:\n\nAll code must run;\nEach problem set material will have its own GitHub repository;\nReadable Solutions: To facilitate effective evaluation and comprehension of the coding assignments, students must adhere to the following standards for code readability:\n\nComprehensive Commenting: All code must include thorough comments. These comments are essential as they allow the Professor and Teaching Assistants to understand the purpose and functionality of the code solely through these annotations. It is crucial that the comments are clear and concise, providing insight into the logic and purpose behind each segment of code.\n\n\nStructured Code Segmentation: Solutions should be methodically organized into distinct code chunks within Jupyter or R Markdown notebooks. For clarity on this format, refer to examples provided in class or consult with the Professor or Teaching Assistants.\n\n\nDetailed Documentation of Functions: Every function defined by a student must be accompanied by a docstring. This documentation should clearly explain the function’s purpose, describe each input argument, and outline what the function returns.",

You must refine your prompts to achieve desirable outcomes. Use the course knowledge for that!\nDo not blindly trust the information provided by the output. If the output contains a number, index, analysis, conclusion, or fact, assume it is incorrect and check its veracity. Any errors or omissions resulting from using the AI tool will be your responsibility. Remember, the AI tool works better for topics that you already understand.\nWhile AI is a tool, you must acknowledge its use. Always cite!

The Honor Code of Emory College is based on the fundamental assumption that every loyal person of the University not only will conduct his or her own life according to the dictates of the highest honor, but will also refuse to tolerate in others action which would sully the good name of the institution. Academic misconduct is an offense generally defined as any action or inaction which is offensive to the integrity and honesty of the members of the academic community. The typical sanction for a violation of the Emory Honor Code is an F in the course. Any suspected case of academic misconduct will be referred to the Emory Honor Council.",

Note that each appointment will be 15-minutes long, and it may be done in a small group or individually. No appointments will be allowed nearing the exam dates.\nWhen attending virtual office hours, make sure you are in a private setting with a little to no background noise. The use of headphones is strongly encouraged. This is especially true when you are discussing private matters with the instructor.\nDo not use email for asking content-related questions, and do not use Canvas messages.\nDo not email me your private stories. Keep your email brief, and you will receive a response from me within 48 hours, except for the weekends. Similarly, if you receive an email from me, you are also expected to respond within 48 hours. Set up an individual appointment to discuss such things.\nFinally, if you are experiencing situations that negatively impact your overall student life, you should immediately contact the Office of Undergraduate Education.",
