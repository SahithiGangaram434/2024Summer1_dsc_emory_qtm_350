    "The number of iterations for the inner loop starts at 0 (when `i` is 0) and increases by one each time the outer loop increments. This creates a series of iterations that resembles the sum of the first `n` integers, which can be calculated by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The outer loop runs `n` times.\n",
    "2. Inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop that runs `n/3` times. Since `n/3` is essentially dividing `n` by a constant, the time complexity for this loop is still $O(n)$.\n",
    "3. Inside the inner loop, there is a call to the function `cabin(n)`. From a previous analysis, we determined that `cabin(n)` has a logarithmic time complexity of $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the overall time complexity, we consider the work done at each level:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first loop contributes $O(n)$.\n",
    "- The second loop contributes $O(n)$, but since it's inside the first loop, their combined contribution is $O(n^2)$.\n",
    "- The call to `cabin(n)` inside the inner loop introduces a factor of $O(\\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for each iteration of the inner loop, the `cabin(n)` function is called, which means the time complexity for all calls to `cabin(n)` within the entire execution of `log_cabin(n)` will be $O(n^2 \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that if the recursive call to `cabin(n)` were actually `cabin(n//3)` or similar, this would change the analysis as the recursive calls would reduce the size of the problem in each iteration. However, since `cabin(n)` is called with the full size `n` every time, it does not reduce the problem size and the complexity is determined by the number of times it's called, which is proportional to the number of iterations of the inner loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the time complexity of `log_cabin(n)` is $O(n^2 \\log n)$, and the space complexity is $O(1)$ plus the space complexity of the recursive calls to `cabin(n)`, which we previously determined to be $O(1)$ as well. However, if we take into account the space used by the system stack during recursion, each recursive call to `cabin(n)` adds to the call stack, resulting in a space complexity that would be $O(\\log n)$ due to the depth of the recursive calls. Thus, the total space complexity would be $O(\\log n)$ accounting for recursion stack space."

Instead, it creates an infinite loop, and therefore we cannot determine a standard time complexity using big-O notation as the function does not complete.\n",
